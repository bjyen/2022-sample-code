# 2022-sample-code

This respiratory includes the codes which show my capability for data wrangling, and statistical modeling.

- In `diag_2007_2015.rmd`, I include the R code from my current ongoing dissertation in which I manage the electronic health claims such as Optum© De-Identified Clinformatics® data mart from 2007 to 2021. This file includes the loops I used to read the health claim data for multiple years and merge the multi-year datasets to one file.  
- In `2022_economic_abuse_published.do`, I include the Stata code for the analysis and tables in a recent publication which I am fully responsible for the statistical analysis section.
